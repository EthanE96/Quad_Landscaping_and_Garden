              <h4 > How often should I water my plants? </h4>
              <p> The general rule is that you should water your plants once or twice a week, using enough 
              water to moisten the soil to a depth of about 6 inches each time. </p>

              <h4> How often should I fertilize my plants? </h4>
              <p> When and how often you need to fertilize your plants largely depends on the type of soil
              that the plants are rooted in. It is typically recommended to use two to three pounds of fertilizer 
              for every 100 square feet of garden area. </p>

              <h4> Any advice on spending less money on plants? </h4>
              <p> Besides saving seeds and dividing perennials in late spring, take cuttings of annuals

              <h4> What type of soil should I use for replotting? </h4>
              <p> Most plants grow perfectly fine in regular plotting soil. On some occasions, you might
              want to add some grit such as perlite or sand for extra drainage. </p>

              <h4> How can I prevent or deal with flies and fungus gnats? </h4>
              <p> One of the things you can do is to simply use a fork to rake the top level of the soil once 
                or twice a week. In case you notice that you have an infestation, spray your plant 
                with some Neem Oil. </p>

              <h4> Why are my plants' leaves leaves drooping or yellowing? </h4>
              <p> If you see that there are some leaves yellowing, but there are new ones still growing, then 
                this is just the natural process of aging. If you don't see any signs of new growth and the leaves 
                are getting brown and drooping, this may mean that you are overwatering. </p>

                <h5 class="mb-1"> Break Ground!!! </h5>
                <p class="mb-1">The easiest way to become a successful gardener is to go out there and do it! There will be problems,
                  there will be mistakes, there will be accidents. Do not let them discourage you. Remember that you are 
                  a beginner and that these things happen even to master gardeners. Get out there and show your plant
                  some love. You wanted to start gardening for a reason, go out there and bring your goals to life.</p>

                <h5 class="mb-1"> Soil Importance </h5>
                <p class="mb-1">Soil is one of the most important aspects to your gardens success. Placing your plants in pots will
                  help ensure your garden does not become overcrowded. If you would prefer not to use pots, make sure
                  your plants are spaced out. Plan ahead for your plants growing in size as they mature. Local lawn-care
                  and outdoor stores should be able to provide garden soil, an excellent resource for beginning gardeners.</p>
