        1. Plan Ahead
        It can be easy to be discouraged when starting a garden, but don't worry.
        Everyone runs into this when starting a garden. Begin by making a plan. Answer a few questions
        for yourself. What plants am I interested in? Can those plants grow in my climate? How long do
        they take to grow? Where am I going to grow them at? Answering these questions will give you more
        of a concrete idea on what your garden will be.

        2. Start Small 
        Even the biggest projects had the smallest beginnings. Starting a garden is already overwhelming. 
        Start small to ensure you can give each of your plants the attention they need. You can always add 
        plants to your garden in the future. Once you feel comfortable with maintaining your garden, you can
        grow it as you see fit. 
      </div>
      <div>
        3. Get Excited!
        Gardening is an enjoyable hobby for many people. Choose plants that excite and interest you. Nothing
        is more satisfying than growing a fruit or vegetable you love and being able to taste it at the end.
        Goals like this to look forward to is what makes gardening fun. The beauty of the final result is 
        enough to bring any gardener back for another cycle.

        4. Soil Importance
        Soil is one of the most important aspects to your gardens success. Placing your plants in pots will
        help ensure your garden does not become overcrowded. If you would prefer not to use pots, make sure
        your plants are spaced out. Plan ahead for your plants growing in size as they mature. Local lawn-care
        and outdoor stores should be able to provide garden soil, an excellent resource for beginning gardeners.

        there will be mistakes, there will be accidents. Do not let them discourage you. Remember that you are 
        a beginner and that these things happen even to master gardeners. Get out there and show your plant
        some love. You wanted to start gardening for a reason, go out there and bring your goals to life.
